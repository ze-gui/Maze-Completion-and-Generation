This work was developed in windows 11, but it is also compatible with windows 10 and Linux.
To run this code you need to install webots and a python IDE(I used JetBrain PyCharm, when installing it should also install matplotlib, pandas, numpy and networkx)
After installing the necessary applications, you should connect PyCharm to the directory of Webots.
To run each algorithm, you need to open the maze located in *\worlds\custom_maps\maze_*_*.wbts on Webots and verify in the algorithm file if the map_name is the one maze selected in webots. Also, you need to verify if the final_positon, max_x and max_y are defined to the maze selected(only maze_10_* need different variables because of its size).
After everything, you can run the code correctly.
